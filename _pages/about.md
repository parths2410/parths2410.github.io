Hey! I'm Parth, welcome to my small space on the internet.

I'll be joining the MS in Robotics Systems Development (MRSD) at Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University for it's 2023-2025 cohort.

My interests revolves around ______.

Before joining CMU, I worked as a Research Associate at Dr. K Madhava Krishna's Robotics Research Center @ IIIT-Hyderabad on developing a Autonomous Driving Stack and  Learning-based Planning. Prior to this, I worked as a Robotics Software Engineer at Rightbot, where we developed robots for nano-fulfillment warehouses.   

In 2022, I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology degree majoring in Computer Engineering. During my undergrad, I was associated with Orion Racing India - Formula Student Team as a Driverless Engineer working. I was also an Embedded Engineer with Team KJSCE Robocon.

On the fun side, I play table-tennis, go running and binge a lot.
