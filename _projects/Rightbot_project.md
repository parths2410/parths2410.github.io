Rightbot is a robotics startup focused on “Goods to Person (G2P)” warehouse automation – critically needed by online commerce players to satisfy the needs of their demanding consumers.

I joined Rightbot in September 2021 for my Senior-year Co-Op program, and was associated with them for nearly a year.  

Joining a start-up in its young phase, enabled me to work on all layers of the software-stack and deepened my knowledge of embedded systems, ROS, navigation algorithms and back-end development.

### Robot-Fleets for Warehouses

For major-part of my time at rightbot, we developed a fleet of AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicle) for QuickCommerce Warehouse Clients.

I designed and developed a Micro-Service based Warehouse Management System (WMS). 
For this, I used Spring as the web-framework, Kafka Streams for communication with Fleet-Management System, Reddis for cache-memory, Postgres as the Database, and PostMan for API-testing.

One of the major takeaways from this experience was realizing the amount of reliability and precision required in such projects before deploying them for public use. We developed an entire suite of safety features along with fail-safe recovery mechanisms to ensure safe human-robot interactions in the warehouse.

Here's a video of the prototype phase:
