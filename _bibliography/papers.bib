  abstract={In this paper we show an effective means of integrating data driven frameworks to sampling based optimal control to vastly reduce the compute time for easy adoption and adaptation to real time applications such as on-road autonomous driving in the presence of dynamic actors. Presented with training examples, a spatio-temporal CNN learns to predict the optimal mean control over a finite horizon that precludes further resampling, an iterative process that makes sampling based optimal control formulations difficult to adopt in real time settings. Generating control samples around the network-predicted optimal mean retains the advantage of sample diversity while enabling real time rollout of trajectories that seamlessly avoids multiple dynamic obstacles in an on-road navigation setting. Further the 3D convolution network architecture implicitly learns the future trajectories of the dynamic agents in the scene resulting in successful collision free navigation despite no explicit future trajectory prediction. We show performance gain over multiple baselines in a number of on-road scenes through closed loop simulations in CARLA. We also showcase the real world applicability of our system by running it on our custom Autonomous Driving Platform (AutoDP).},
